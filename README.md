# ðŸŒŸ AI-Vibe Coding Projects

This repo lists all the projects where I used AI tools (like ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot) to help me write, plan, debug, or refine code. These tools helped speed up my workflow and improve the quality of my projects.

- [Slang Sleuth](https://github.com/Xain1501/SlangSleuth.git): Allows People to search GenZ slangs and learn what they mean.


## ðŸŽ¯ Why This Repo?
Many of my repos show working code, but this one highlights how I utilized AI to turn my ideas into features and my thoughts into code  â€” not just what I made, but **how** I made it.

 **#PS:** This repo collects all the projects where I used AI tools while coding.  
These projects might also be part of other repos, but this one keeps them grouped based on AI involvement â€” so itâ€™s easier to explore vibe-coded work specifically.
